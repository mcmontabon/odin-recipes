The beauty of Filipino food lies in its diversity and ability to incorporate a wide range of influences into a cohesive and delicious whole. Authentic Filipino cuisine has developed from the various cultures that have shaped its history, making it distinct from its neighbors like Vietnam and Thailand. The cooking methods and ingredients used in Filipino dishes bring out unique flavors, balancing sweet, sour, and salty tastes. With its rich history, traditional cooking techniques, and the talent for combining flavors, Filipino cuisine offers unpretentious, no-frills food that is absolutely delicious. - MakeYourAsia
