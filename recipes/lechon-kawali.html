		<p>
			Lechon kawali or Pan-roasted pork to some is different from Lechon, the
			well known Filipino dish which is also the national dish of the
			Philippines. While lechon is cooked in a pit filled with flamed charcoal,
			Lechon kawali is cooked by boiling then later deep frying a portion of the
			pig (pork belly usually).
