		<h3>Ingredients for Filipino Fried Chicken</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 whole chicken</li>
			<li>
				Soy sauce, calamansi, ground black pepper, Maggi Magic Sarap, and
				paprika
			</li>
			<li>All-purpose flour, cornstarch and spices</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a bowl, combine calamansi juice, soy sauce, ground black pepper,
				Maggi Magic Sarap, and paprika. Mix well. The marinade helps tenderize
				the chicken while infusing it with flavor.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place the butterflied whole chicken in a resealable bag and pour in the
				marinade. Remove excess air before sealing the bag to allow the marinade
				to coat the chicken evenly. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour to let the
				flavors absorb fully.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a separate bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion
				powder, and baking powder. Mix it thoroughly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dredge the marinated chicken in the breading mixture, ensuring every
				part is covered. Shake off any excess flour to prevent clumping. Put the
				coated chicken on a plate and let it stay for 5 minutes before frying.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat a good amount of cooking oil in a wok until it reaches 300Â°F.
				Carefully place the chicken in the hot oil and deep fry for 25 minutes,
				turning it halfway through to ensure even cooking. The high heat crisps
				the breading while sealing in the juices.
			</li>
			<li>
				Once fried, transfer the chicken to a wire rack to cool slightly. This
				step prevents excess oil from making the breading soggy. Serve on a
				plate with Filipino-style chicken gravy and enjoy a meal that is crispy,
				flavorful, and satisfying.
			</li>
		</ol>
